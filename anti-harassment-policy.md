3. **Reporting Harassment**\
    If you experience or witness harassment or unacceptable behavior during the symposium, we encourage you to report it immediately. The EDS 2025 team is here to support you and take appropriate action. You can report harassment in the following ways:
      - In-person: Speak with a designated member of the EDS 2025 organizing team, identifiable by their badges or role at the event.
      - Online: Use the designated email address or digital reporting platform (provided in the symposium materials) to report incidents confidentially.

    All reports will be handled seriously and with sensitivity. We aim to ensure that all individuals feel heard, supported, and safe.
4. **Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior**\
    Any participant found violating this Anti-Harassment Policy will be subject to appropriate consequences, including but not limited to:
    - Verbal or written warning.
    - Temporary or permanent removal from symposium events.
    - Reporting the behavior to relevant authorities, if necessary.

    The decision regarding any consequences will be made by the symposium organizing team and will take into account the severity of the incident, the well-being of the affected individuals, and the overall integrity of the symposium.
5. **Commitment to a Safe and Welcoming Environment**\
We are dedicated to maintaining a safe and welcoming environment for all participants. EDS 2025 strives to be a place where researchers, students, and professionals can engage, collaborate, and exchange ideas in a respectful and supportive setting. By adhering to this Anti-Harassment Policy, we collectively ensure that everyone has the opportunity to fully participate and benefit from the symposium.
