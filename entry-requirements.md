## For Schengen Area Citizens:
Citizens from the Schengen Area can enter Poland without the need for a visa or additional documentation, as Poland is a part of the Schengen Zone. However, it is essential to ensure that your passport or ID card remains valid for the duration of your stay.

## For Non-Schengen Area Citizens:
If you are a citizen from outside the Schengen Area, you may need to obtain a visa to enter Poland. The visa requirements depend on your nationality, the purpose of your visit, and the length of your stay. For the latest information on visa applications, including types of visas and required documents, visit the [Ministry of the Interior and Administration of the Republic of Poland website](https://www.gov.pl/web/mswia-en/entry-and-residence-conditions-for-foreign-nationals-in-poland).

## Healthcare system
Poland's medical facilities are on par with those in other EU countries. The public provider of medical services is the [National Health Fund  (NFZ)](https://www.nfz.gov.pl/dla-pacjenta/medical-treatment-abroad/). Private healthcare services are relatively affordable and maintain a high standard.

EU nationals are entitled to free emergency medical treatment in Poland. Therefore, as a EU-citizen you should obtain a [European Health Insurance Card (EHIC)](https://employment-social-affairs.ec.europa.eu/policies-and-activities/moving-working-europe/eu-social-security-coordination/european-health-insurance-card_en) before your trip. However, please note that the EHIC does not cover medical repatriation, ongoing treatment, or non-urgent care. It is advisable to check whether your travel insurance includes coverage for these situations.
