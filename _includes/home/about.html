                ecosystem by
                fostering collaboration, excellence, and inclusivity in AI research. The symposium contributes to this
                mission by
                bringing together PhD students and early-career researchers from across Europe to exchange ideas,
                present their work,
                and engage in discussions around the development of robust and trustworthy AI systems.
                ELLIS PhD students can apply for mobility funding to attend EDS 2025 in Warsaw through the ELIAS
                project.
